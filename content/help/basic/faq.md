## 1. How to set up Dashbird?
Setting up Dashbird takes under 5 minutes and requires no code changes.

To start, [sign up](/signup) and follow the on-screen instructions linking your AWS account with Dashbirds.

Full instructions can be found [here](/help/basic/get-started).

## 2. Is there any overhead?
**Dashbird does not affect the performance of your Lambda functions.**

Dashbird gets all of the information from logs when they reach AWS CloudWatch, meaning that the service has no effect on the execution itself.

## 3. Is there added cost for my AWS bill?
**There is almost no added cost to your AWS bill.**

AWS prices Data-transfer out of CloudWatch equivalently to Data-transfer from EC2.

The first GB of the month is free, with every GB after that $0.09.

## 4. What is the latency of Dashbird?
It normally takes about 1-2 minutes from execution data to be visible in Dashbird.

## 5. How do I change my password?
To change your password:
_User menu -> Preferences -> change password -> insert new password_

## 6. How to invite team members?
You can invite as many team members to Dashbird as you like.

_User menu -> Invite users -> Add +_

Fill in the form:
![Invite user](/images/help/inviteuser.png 'Invite user')

## 7. Can I choose which Lambda functions get monitored?
**Yes.**

You can control our log importer by specifying filters.
Navigate to _User menu -> Importer settings_
![Lambda filtering](/images/help/filtering.png 'Lambda filtering')

Filters are <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)' target='_blank'>glob patterns</a>.

Use <code>some-service-*</code> to include and <code>!some-service-prod-*</code> to exclude lambda functions.

By default, all lambdas are imported to Dashbird.

You can disable Dashbird from accessing your AWS by deleting the Role and Policy created on signup.

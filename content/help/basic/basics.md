Dashbird is a service to monitor, debug and improve your lambda functions. **It's tailor made to help develop Serverless apps.**

Building Serverless architectures is one of the fastest and cheapest ways to construct scalable and cheap backend applications. Yet, with large architectures, they can sometimes be hard to monitor and effectively handle errors.

### Account overview
Dashbird provides users an overview of all lambda executions across the entire account. This makes it super-easy to keep an eye on lambda functions and also to know what is going on at any moment in the app.

### Service view
Dashbird allows you to group functions any way you like. This allows you to construct a dashboard for a service, outlining its load, problems, cost and other important metrics.

### Function view
Shows health, cost and other meaningful statistics of a lambda function. You can also see the history of last invocations and separate errors at a glance.

### Invocation view
An overview and logs for each invocation.

The service also **detects errored code executions** so you can track immediately if something is wrong and fix it.

## Requirements for setting up Dashbird

To set up Dashbird you need to have the following.

- Open your [AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com).
- Navigate to `IAM` → `Policies` → `Create Policy`.
- Select `Create your own policy`
- Fill the form:
  - Policy name: `dashbird-policy`.
  - Policy Document:

      ```JSON
      {
          "Version": "2012-10-17",
          "Statement": [
              {
                  "Effect": "Allow",
                  "Action": "logs:FilterLogEvents",
                  "Resource": "*"
              },

                  "Resource": "*"
              }
          ]
      }
      ```


### 2. Add a new AWS role for Dashbird:

- Navigate to `IAM` → `Roles` → `Create New Role`.

  - `Role for cross-account access`
- Select
  - `Provide access between your AWS account and a 3rd party AWS account`
- Fill out the following:
 - Account ID (Dashbird): `458024764010`
 - External ID: **copy from the onboarding app**
 - Require MFA: `false`
 - Click **Next step**
- Select previously created `dashbird-policy` from the policies list.
- Click **Next step**
- Fill out the following for role name and review

### 3. Setup Dashbird with the created role

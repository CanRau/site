_Dashbird is a service to monitor, debug and improve your lambda functions._

### Problem
Building microservice architetures is one of the fastest and cheapest ways to construct scalable and cheap backend applications. With large function based architectures however, there can be a problem that they are hard to monitor or debug in case of errors.

### Solution
Dashbird provides users an overview of all lambda executions across the entire account. This makes it super-easy to keep an eye on lambda functions and also to know what is going on at any moment in the app. The service also **detects errored code executions** so you can track immediately if something is wrong and fix it.

From ancient Rome and Greece throughout Latin America and Egypt, there is only one thing beside the history itself that kept those ancient times alive even today – the architecture. The most important part of any era in our immersive history was the building of magnificent objects all around the world. These objects, even today, are some of the many wonders of the world. This time, in our era, we will talk about modern, computing architecture that will hopefully leave its trace in the upcoming millennia by building our world into a significantly better future.

## Lambda Architecture Explained

Lambda architecture is a data-processing architecture that is designed to process vast amounts of data. Lambda architecture is taking advantage of two methods, which are batch and streaming-processing. This particular approach to architecture is an attempt to balance the latency, throughput, and mistake tolerance by using batch processing to provide us with accurate views of batch data while at the same time it uses a real-time stream processing to give us the views of online data. This rise of Lambda architecture is in correlation with the ever-growing big data, real-time analytics, and the drive to cut down the latencies of map-reduce.

## What Is Lambda Architecture Made Of?

Lambda architecture is describing a system that is consisted of three different layers. The first layer is **batch processing**, which essentially precomputes the results by utilizing a processing system that is already distributed which can handle enormous quantities of data. This layer’s primary goal is to be entirely accurate by being able to process all available data when it’s generating the views. Basically, this means that the batch layer can fix any errors or issues by recomputing, which is based on the complete data set. The output is mainly stored in a read-only database, whose updates completely replace the existing precomputed views. A standard batch-processing system which is most frequently used in high-throughput architectures is for sure the Apache Hadoop system.

**Speed processing aka real-time processing** is yet another layer that processes data streams in real-time, and it doesn’t require completeness. This layer strives to minimize the latency as much as possible, so it sacrifices throughput, and it provides real-time views into the most recent data. This layer is the one that is responsible for filling up the empty space which is caused by the batch layer’s lag in providing the views based on the most recent data. This layer’s views may not have the accuracy or completeness as the ones that are produced by the batch layers, but there is a positive side of them. They are available almost instantly after the data is received, and they can as well be switched when the batch layer’s views for the same data become accessible. SQLstream, Apache Spark, and Apache Storm are some of the stream-processing technologies used in this layer.

**Serving layer**, as its name suggests, is a layer that stores the output from the batch and speed layers. Serving layer responds to queries by returning precomputed views or even building up views from the processed data. Druid is one of the technologies that are used in the serving layer. Druid provides a single cluster so that it can handle the output from both layers. There are dedicated stores used in the serving layer, and they include Apache Cassandra, Apache HBase, MongoDB, VoltDB, or even Elasticsearch. For speed layer output. For batch layer output the dedicated stores include Elephant DB, Apache Impala, SAP HANA or even Apache Hive.

## Who Is Using Lambda Architecture?

Metamarkets provide analytics for companies and firms in the programmatic advertisement, and they employ lambda architecture version that is using Druid for storing and serving batch-processed as well as stream-processed data. Yahoo! took very similar step by using Apache Storm, Druid, and Apache Hadoop to run the analytics on its advertising warehouse. Also, worth mentioning is the Netflix Suro project. The Netflix Suro project has separate processing paths for data, but bare in mind that it doesn’t actually strictly follows the lambda architecture since the paths might serve different purposes and may not provide the same type of views. The “grand plan” is to make a selection of real-time based event data that is available for queries with very low latency while all of the data set is also processed by a batch pipeline which is intended for applications that are not very sensitive to latency, and which require a map-reduce type of processing.

## The Advice For Beginners

In case you wish to build a well-designed, reliable and functional big data application that takes care of a variety of end-user latency needs, it can be an incredibly daunting task. It is quite challenging to keep up with the speed at which the technological innovations are happening in this space, let alone to build an application that works for the problem you’re dealing with. “Taking baby steps and building one application at a time” is probably the most frequent advice given to newbies nowadays. However, specific high-end architectural constructs can help you with making a visualization on how many different kinds of applications fit with the big data architecture and how some of these technologies are shapeshifting the existing software landscape.

To create is to build, and to build is to leave a trace behind yourself. Our ancestors left many paths for us to follow, and in the future (or in THE NOW) it is up to us to leave something for the future generations.

Traditionally, server management has been essential to running a successful online business. About 24% of companies claim that just an hour of server downtime costs them <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/753938/worldwide-enterprise-server-hourly-downtime-cost/">at least $300,000</a>. But what if you didn't have to deal with servers at all?
That might sound like a pipe dream, but with services like AWS Lambda, we're getting closer to that reality every day. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambda</a> lets you run code without using a server instance.

<h3>What is AWS Lambda?</h3>
AWS Lambda is a service that lets you run your own code on Amazon's servers, so you don't need to host the code yourself. Best of all, you don't pay a dime when your code isn't being used.
You only pay for computation time. Your code can sit on the server for months, and if you don't touch it, Amazon doesn't charge you.
So, why would you use AWS Lambda?

<h3>AWS Lambda Use Cases</h3>
Let's look at just a few examples on how you can use AWS Lambda to make your life easier starting right now!

<h2>Security Updates</h2>
You can write a lambda function that will monitor your website's log files.
Set up your lambda function so that when a log file changes, it triggers the lambda code. Your code can perform any number of analyses on the log files which will give you important security information.
Have the lambda function send a report to your email address. You'll never again miss an important security event.

<h2>Automated Backups</h2>
You can easily write a lambda function that will automatically create backups of important information.
If you want to keep it simple, set the backup to occur at the end of every day. If you want a more sophisticated backup mechanism, backup your information every time it changes.

<h2>Serverless Website</h2>
You can store your website content <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">on S3</a> and outsource all computations to AWS Lambda. This allows you to run your website without paying for any actual server space. It's a <a href="https://dashbird.io/blog/create-your-first-website-in-15-minutes/">serverless website</a>.
You'll need to pay for your S3 space and your lambda calculations. But if it's a low-traffic site, this could save you a lot of money. And if there's a huge bump in traffic, AWS will adjust to provide you with the necessary resources.
You'll also have the security and uptime benefits of using Amazon's servers.

<h2>File Conversion</h2>
A lambda function can provide a quick way to convert files. Imagine you have an application that outputs files at random times. And you want to convert those files to an easier to use format.
You can set the application to send the files to a lambda function that does the conversion for you. You won't have to run code on your own server, and you'll be able to convert files with ease.

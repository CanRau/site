We have some exciting news! We got accepted as AWS Lambda monitoring partner. Among other things, it means that Dashbird is now recognized to have **verified track record of delivering specific AWS services and workloads to AWS customers.** 

PS: We will be featured on AWS Lambda Partners site and have the option to showcase our users' workflows there. If you are interested in getting that kind of exposure for your company, all you have to do is write a case study about using AWS Lambda and Dashbird. <a href='mailto: hello@dashbird.io'>Contact us</a> for more information!

As we all know (or don’t!) serverless computing has brought us so many benefits in our every-day developer lives. Serverless makes it so much easier for us to focus on many other tasks while serverless computing is doing its tasks, giving us the opportunity to do more, do better, do like never before. When serverless computing came to the scene, various serverless startups began to emerge too. Some of them based their businesses on serverless computing while others decided to implement their ideas to make serverless even better. Their goal is to make development much faster, but also more comfortable. To give a chance to those who already lost too much of their energy to do what they like, but in a brand new, quicker and more enjoyable way.

Does serverless offer enough features and is it cutting cost considerably, or not? The speed of the delivery is yet another thing you wish to know, as well as how much it can reduce your AWS bill, right? 

If you are thinking of switching to serverless but you are still unsure of how much time it could save for you or how much money you would save, visit our [serverless survey and find out all about the business benefits serverless has to offer](https://medium.com/@AnnikaHelendi/serverless-survey-77-delivery-speed-4-dev-workdays-mo-saved-26-aws-monthly-bill-d99174f70663).

Some of the most interesting serverless startups that showed up with the serverless movement, and we’ll try to explain what their role in all of this is, as well as what are their ideas and how do they help us in using serverless computing today.

### Dashbird.io

![dashbird](/images/blog/2018-07-02/dashbird-1.jpg)

[Dashbird](https://dashbird.io/features/) was founded in August 2017 and ever since, they’re helping developers create faster, stronger and unbreakable serverless applications. Dashbird is offering insights, error alerts and debugging features, which further make software and application development much faster and it also helps very much with performance and cost optimization. AWS Lambda architecture monitoring is keeping a close eye on every execution and failures while it's having an excellent response time for negative trends. Locating the most problematic functions and services very quickly, and then evaluating the size of the issue. Another feature Dashbird uses is CloudWatch logs allowing them to offer in-depth analytics. The setup is very quick (maybe 2 minutes) and it doesn’t require you to make any changes to your code.

### Serverless Framework

![serverless framework](/images/blog/2018-07-02/serverless-1.jpg)

Serverless Inc. is yet another serverless startup, and was founded in 2015. They offer an open-source CLI for building serverless architectures. The {Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com/) is a single toolkit for serverless architecture deployment to any chosen provider. They are building the infrastructure based upon the features you have built. Their implementation is centralized to AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Platform, IBM OpenWhisk and Microsoft Azure. Dozens of pre-made plugins are available, or you could create your own for your own needs. The Framework is open-source, and it is effortless to build for. Multiple different languages are also offered so you can write your functions in Python, Node.js or Java in other languages too. Automatic scaling means that serverless architecture expands contract on demand and by doing so, cutting costs by more than a half. Infinitely scalable applications can be developed and deployed within minutes. Serverless Framework also offers the “Unified Dev Experience” which essentially means that you can develop, test and implement functions and the events that they react to on any cloud provider.

### ServerlessOps

</p>

In January 2018, Tom McLaughlin founded a startup by the name of [ServerlessOps](https://www.serverlessops.io/). His primary objective is to focus more on people and the process itself rather than on your cloud infrastructure. DevOps transformation through AWS serverless offers DevOps transformation advisory. Put in the simple words, they’ll work with you to better understand your goals, make a success defined and above all, with your engineers and leadership team, they strive to deliver solutions. ServerlessOps also offer a serverless infrastructure training program. This training could be corporate or event training in AWS serverless infrastructure, while the main focus goes to operations. You could start by learning how to build a serverless system and continue to learn how to make that system reliable to run, scale and how to secure it. Basically, ServerlessOps wants to teach you <a target="_blank" href="https://www.serverlessops.io/blog/serverless-ops-what-do-we-do-when-the-server-goes-away">what to do when the traditional servers</a> go away and how to best proceed.

</p>

Another serverless startup is [IOPipe](https://www.iopipe.com/), founded in 2016 by Adam Johnson and Erica Windisch. Adam and Erica had a vision of eliminating the risks for developers and operations teams building serverless applications. IOPipe was built to be an extension of your development and operations teams coming up with the right information at the exact right time. IOPipe is a serverless DevOps based platform allowing its users to develop much faster, while it also provides more in-depth visibility into serverless applications at a scale that are already running in production. The features that come with using IOPipe are numerous like real-time analytics. Telemetry is analyzed and displayed in less than only 3 seconds. From the very beginning, the design of IOPipe platform is very responsive since it’s made to fit perfectly on an any-sized device. Alerts about your serverless applications are crucial for your apps to work in a continuous flow. If anything happens out of the ordinary, you’ll be alerted. You will also obtain several ways to customize your alerts which makes you sure that you’ve reached individuals who need to see but all in the form of your workflow.

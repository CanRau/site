With the state of serverless growing at an exponential rate during the last year it's no surprise developers across the globe have flocked to use **AWS Lambda as their main serverless compute engine**. AWS has a steady track record of covering all the main needs of developers, devops engineers and even C-level tech executives. Hell, I've been using it for a couple of years, and still haven't come close to check out even half of their offering. 

## Disappointment turned to joy 
So, after all that, tell me, why haven't we had the joy of using the newest version of Node.js on AWS Lambda? Strange indeed. The _de facto_ goto compute service for serverless has limited Node.js developers to use outdated versions of their favorite language **\*sad face\***. All that changes now, **with the [public release](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/node-js-8-10-runtime-now-available-in-aws-lambda/) of a new supported version of Node.js. To be more precise, it's version `8.10`. We now finally have beloved features at our disposal running natively in the AWS Lambda runtime.** Praise all things holy!

## Out with the old, in with the new
Remember that clunky `callback` parameter every lambda function has? Here's some pseudo code showing a generic login function.

_**Note**: Examples are written in Node.js using the Serverless Framework._

Yeah, well now you don't need them anymore! Because `Promises` are totally native in the new Node.js version, we can now just return the whole `Promise` chain instead! Don't believe me? Check it!

<script src="https://gist.github.com/adnanrahic/e8b45fb452f5ce53d3907b9f184b22c8.js"></script>

How amazing is this!? No more fiddling with annoying callbacks. Using `Promises` natively and chaining them in the same way you're already used to in your day-to-day life is just a breath of fresh air for serverless developers worldwide. 

My life has just become **40% more joyful**, just by starting to use `Promises` in my lambda functions. If you want to know why exactly 40%, hit me with a comment below **(_points at comment section_)** . I may be joking, just a bit. **\*wink\* \*wink\***

Okay, but that's not all. You know about my good friend `async` and his twin brother `await`? Yeah, I had a chat with them a while back and to be honest, they're thrilled to finally be invited aboard serverless hype train. **\*crowd cheers\***

Now you can make your lambda function `async` and `await` every particular asynchronous piece of code within the lambda itself! Have a look below.

That is so sexy! Finally a reason to use `try catch` blocks in JavaScript! I haven't seen one of those since 2015 when I last tortured myself with C#. Good times. Hope to forget them as soon as possible.

**Re-write**:
Another great advantage of async/await is better error handling. You can use a try/catch block inside the scope of an async function. Even though the function awaits an asynchronous operation, any errors end up in the catch block.

**Re-write**:
You may port your existing Node.js 4.3 and 6.10 functions over to Node.js 8.10 by updating the runtime. Node.js 8.10 does include numerous breaking changes from previous Node versions.
Make sure to review the API changes between Node.js 4.3, 6.10, and Node.js 8.10 to see if there are other changes that might affect your code. We recommend testing that your Lambda function passes internal validation for its behavior when upgrading to the new runtime version.
You can use Lambda versions/aliases to safely test that your function runs as expected on Node 8.10, before routing production traffic to it.


## Make sure to specify the new version
While configuring the [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com/) for local development, like every other sane human being, you need to specify the runtime underneath the `provider` section. Like this.

```yaml
# serverless.yml
...
provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: nodejs8.10
  stage: dev
  ...
```

Or if you like torture, and create your lambda function through the AWS Console, specify the version during the actual creation.

## Having an overview of your Node.js versions
We at [Dashbird](https://dashbird.io/) have done our best to give you the ability to see which language and runtime is running inside your lambda functions.

## Why would you want the new runtime?
**Re-write**:
You can now get better performance when compared to the previous LTS version 6.x (up to 20%). The new V8 6.0 engine comes with Turbofan and the Ignition pipeline, which leads to lower memory consumption and faster startup time across Node.js applications.

HTTP/2, which is subject to future changes, allows developers to use the new protocol to speed application development and undo many of HTTP/1.1 workarounds to make applications faster, simpler, and more powerful.

Now I’m sure this is not the case for everyone but for me personally, I like watching video tutorials on subjects that I need help with. I spent a good amount of time searching for these tutorials and while there might be a lot more of them out there I believe these are some of the best and easiest tutorials to follow but nevertheless, I’d like to keep this list updated so if you have any suggestions please let me know.

<h2>1. Creating a Python Lambda Function</h2>
Let’s start small and go from there. Python has been getting a lot of interest and this has got to be one of the best tutorials I’ve seen so far.

<h2>2. Using Lambda Functions With NodeJS</h2>
I might be biased here but NodeJS has finally met its match with AWS Lambda. The simplicity of Node is enhanced by the graceful scalability of AWS Lambda, provided you can stay under the concurrency limits.

<h2>3. AWS Lambda for Java - Deploying a function</h2>
Running Java on AWS Lambda is a great idea if you have a lot of consecutive executions. In this video, you’ll see how to deploy and test a serverless AWS Lambda function written in Java om the Amazon Web Services platform.

<h2>4. Building a messaging system with SNS and Lambda</h2>
Learn how Gousto built a robust, asynchronous message bus using AWS Lambda, Amazon SNS, and Amazon SQS to integrate a microservices platform with ERP and warehouse management systems (WMS), which enabled a near real-time flow of events.

<h2>Creating a API with Lambda</h2>
Api’s are the backbone of any modern applications but building efficient can be really tricky. With Api Gateway and Lambdas you can get an API online in less time which makes launching new features a walk in the park

That’s all I have for you this time but like I’ve said in the beginning, I’d love to keep this updated so if there’s a tutorial that you thought stood out from the rest please let me know and I’ll update the list

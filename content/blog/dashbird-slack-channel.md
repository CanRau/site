I'm happy to announce that we are launching our community Slack channel. It's a place designed to provide our users with easy access to the people behind Dashbird and with other members of the community.

<center>![Join Our Slack](/images/blog/2018-10-19/dashbid-slack.jpg)</center>

To join our Slack you can either request an invite by emailing me at john@dashbird.io or by accessing this [URL](https://join.slack.com/t/thedashbird/shared_invite/enQtNDU4MTkzNzQxNzI4LWEyYjJlYmJmYWQ4YWEyMDZhYzY3YTY2ZTVmOTQxMWQ2Y2FkMTY3OGMxMmRlYTE4ZmE3NTk1ZjM0OGE4NWE4Mzk).

<h2>Why should you join?</h2>
I'm glad you asked! Not only will you get easy access to our support and development team but you also get access to a community of like-minded individuals that are going through exactly what you are going.

Another great reason to join the Dashbird.io slack workspace is that besides getting faster access to our support channels you'll get a chance to shape the future of our application by contributing to all the different community engagement efforts like new features discussion and exclusive beta programs.

I look forward to seeing you all there.

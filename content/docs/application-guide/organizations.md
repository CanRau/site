In **Global Search**, Dashbird indexes all logs retrieved from Lambda and provides a full-text search.


Logs can be queried not only by keywords but also by Lambda or *Project* (please refer to the Projects View section of our documentation), invocation status (success or error) and timeframe.


Matching results are highlighted for fast browsing. Each logline is linked to the respective invocation, making it easier to expand all logs from the request, as well as visualize traces from *AWS X-Ray*, for example.

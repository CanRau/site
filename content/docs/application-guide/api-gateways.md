In the **API Gateway** section of the Dashbird interface, we list all your gateways, providing:

* List of endpoints
* Metrics for invocations, errors, duration and, percentage of cold starts
* Link to the Lambda function connected to the Gateway

The data can be filtered using the time period of your interest.

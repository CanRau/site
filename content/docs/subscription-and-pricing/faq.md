### How do I know how many GB I'm using and what plan to choose?

Just sign up for the free trial and check the Subscription page inside the webapp to get an overview of your usage. Don't worry, we don't require credit card information until the end of your trial.

<br>
### What features do I get to use during the free trial?

**All of them!**

<br>

### How much data volume do I get allocated during my 14 day trial?

The default data ingeston limit during the 14 day trial is 5GB. For complex proof of concept pilots of Dashbird, please contact the sales team to cater a greater data volume need for your trial.

<br>

### What happens when I have to upgrade in the middle of the pricing cycle?

Dashbird billing is transparent and fair. If you upgrade your plan in the middle of the billing cycle, you will be charged for the prorated amount.

<br>

### What happens if I go over my ingestion quota?

If you go over your quota, Dashbird will stop processing your logs until the end of the current billing cycle. You won't receive any alerts about errors or policy violations as well. It is possible to upgrade your plan and continue using Dashbird.

<br>

### Do you offer refunds?

No, we don't do refunds. When you are on a monthly or annual subscription, you can cancel that any time and won't be charged again, but you will still have access to your account until the end of that billing period.

<br>

### Do you offer any discounts?

You will get a discount on all plans when you sign up for an annual subscription.

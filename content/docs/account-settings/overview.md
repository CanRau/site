## User settings
After reaching the [User settings](https://app.dashbird.io/profile) you'll have the freedom to edit your general account settings, [change your password](https://app.dashbird.io/profile/password) if you so wish, and of course tweak your E-mail notification settings.

# Organization Settings
Check the [Client Settings](/docs/get-started/say-hi-to-dashbird/) for a more detailed explanation.
<br>Navigate to the Client Settings by pressing **Organization Menu** → **Importer Settings**.

## Importer settings
After reaching the [Client settings](https://app.dashbird.io/client) you'll have the option to filter in/out your Lambda Functions. <br>By default, **all Lambdas** are imported `(*)`. Filters are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)">glob patterns</a>, meaning you can specify which Lambda Functions you want to import by matching a string and a wildcard `(*)`.

Our team is available around the clock to help you in case anything goes wrong. You can reach out to us through the Intercom icon at the bottom left corner of every application page.

Alternatively, you can also write to support@dashbird.io.

Alongside Dashbird customer support team, our engineers are also accessible through Intercom whenever it is important to have a more in-depth technical perspective. You can count that, if and when needed, you will be speaking with a hands-on engineer that knows Lambda and Dashbird from the bottom up.

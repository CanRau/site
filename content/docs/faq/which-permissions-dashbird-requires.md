We have a [CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) stack that automates the setup of your AWS account connection to our log monitoring service. Below is a list of the permissions this CloudFormation stack will require, which operations our system can perform and why we need those.

In case you would like to review the YAML file directly, here is the link to the [CloudFormation stack](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dashbird-cf/cloudformation.yml) hosted in an S3 bucket owned by Dashbird.

## Main Permissions

## Additional Permissions

The services below aren't currently being monitored by Dashbird and we don't use those permissions yet. They are listed in our stack because we have a plan to offer support to those services. We wanted to future-proof our stack and be able to broaden our support to the AWS cloud stack.

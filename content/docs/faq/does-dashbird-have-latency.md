    Does Dashbird have latency?
  </span>
</h2>
It normally takes about 1-2 minutes from execution data to be visible in Dashbird.

Latency is the delay between giving a system input and until it returns the desired outcome. Dashbird has a **~60 second** latency because we fetch logs from your AWS account. Check out our detailed explanation on [Latency](/docs/learn/latency/) to learn more!

Dashbird charges you by the amount of logs generated by your AWS Lambda functions. In some cases, you won't need us to monitor all of them. Some could be used only for testing purposes, for example. In that case, please follow the instructions below:

#### Open your import settings

1. Click the icon in the top right corner of any page and go to "Profile", as showed in the screenshot below.
2. On the left side of the Profile page, under "Organization", click "Import".

![Open Import Settings](/images/docs/open-import-settings.png 'Open Import Settings')

#### Select your matching criteria

You can create filters that matches the names of Lambda functions you want to monitor or not. It is possible to use an asterisk (\*) as a wildcard. It will match any number of characters.

Example:

Let's say you have these functions:

- process_customer-test
- process_customer
- internal_config_function
- image_resizing
- billing_config

And you want to filter **out** all functions that contain "test" or "config" in the name. These two filters will do just that:

![Filter Lambda Functions](/images/docs/filter-lambda-functions.png 'Filter Lambda Functions')

Notice we enclosed the two words with an asterisk (\*), both at the start and end of the matching pattern. If we did not do so, the function "internal_config_function", for example, would not match because the "config" string is in the middle of the function name.

You could as well match a single function by entering its exact name as the matching pattern. In this case, no asterisk is needed.

#### Check the results match your expectation

Right below the list of filters, you will see two lists:

- Importing lambdas: those are the ones Dashbird will be monitoring, based on the filters currently set above;
- Filtered out lambdas: these functions will **not** be monitored by Dashbird;

When a function is filtered **out**, it continues to generate logs and have them saved in CloudWatch normally. Dashbird just won't be collecting them for parsing anymore, that's all. You can change this at any time and Dashbird will resume monitoring the function, but logs generated during the filter out was in place will not be collected in retrospect.

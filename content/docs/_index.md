Dashbird is a service to **monitor**, **debug** and **improve** your lambda functions. **It's tailor made to help develop serverless apps.**

Using serverless architectures is one of the fastest and cheapest ways of building scalable and cheap back-end applications. Yet, with large architectures, they can sometimes be hard to monitor and debug.

### Core Benefits

Dashbird provides an overview of all lambda executions across your entire account. Making it incredibly easy to keep an eye on all lambda functions and to know what's going on at any given moment.

### Project View

Dashbird allows you to group lambda functions any way you like. This allows you to construct a dashboard for a service or set of functions. It will outline the load, any problems you might face, the cost and other important metrics.

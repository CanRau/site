To create an integration with other services, we recommend first integrating Dashbird with Zapier and then using an integration from Zapier to other services.\n\nSetting up webhooks\n\nWebhooks can be set up separately for each lambda. To configure a webhook, open up a href='https://app.dashbird.io/lambdas' target='_blank'Lambda list/a and select the function you want to integrate. You can access the configuration screen under Webhooks tab.\n\nAs a first request after configuring a webhook, Dashbird will try to validate the remote endpoint. For that a POST request with a following payload is made.\n\n{\n    \"ref\": \"1f3ac2f4-c25f-42c6-a131-08b7575abdb5\",\n    \"createdAt\": 1518048245419,\n    \"event\": \"VALIDATION\"\n}\n\nThe endpoint is considered valid when the remote endpoint responds with the following payload.\n\n{\n  \"status\": \"success\"\n}\n\nIf the remote endpoint fails to respond with this payload, the request will be retried with 30 second intervals for 3 times. After which, you can manually retry the webhook with the refresh button.\n\n Supported events\n\nYou can choose the events on which the requests are triggered. We will add more in the future.\n\nINVOCATION_ERROR - triggers each time a lambda execution fails\n\nERRORGROUPCREATED - triggers each time a new error has occurred\n\nERRORGROUPUPDATED - triggers if a new error occurrence was found in importing patch. A new importing patch is imported about every minute, given that the lambda function is active enough.\n",

Logs of the whole invocation, along with memory usage, duration and other meaningful metrics.\n\nOn top of that, Dashbird groups similar errors, making it possible to estimate the scope of the problem and make debugging easier. For example, it might help to better observe the problem if you find some commonalities in the executions.\n\nHere's how a Python error looks like in Dashbird.\n\nExceptions\n\nYou can find a href='https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/pythonexceptions.htm' target='blank'the complete list of Python exceptions here/a.\n\nExceptions are parsed out automatically in Dashbird, and include a rundown of traceback and logs of the specific invocation.\n\n AWS Lambda timeout\n\nAll calls made to AWS Lambda must complete execution within 300 seconds. The default timeout is 3 seconds, but you can set the timeout to any value between 1 and 300 seconds.\n\nNormally, error handling agents are unable to catch timeout errors, because the execution is halted on an upper level. Dashbird, however, reports timeouts like any other type of error. \n\nTimeouts are expressed in Lambda logs in the following way.\n\nREPORT RequestId: 41a10717-e9af-11e7-892c-5bb1a4054ed6  Duration: 300085.71 ms  Billed Duration: 300000 ms Memory Size: 128 MB Max Memory Used: 92 MB\n2017-12-25T20:12:38.950Z 41a10717-e9af-11e7-892c-5bb1a4054ed6 Task timed out after 300.09 seconds\n\nConfiguration errors\n\n Missing module\n\nAnother scenario for errors in AWS Lambda is when you have a missing module included in your function code. In other types of programs, this isn't a very common occurence since a developer would catch that right away. However, with Lambdas, the container is started up on demand, masking the problem until the user encounters it.\n\nWhat's important to note here, is that configuration errors are also not reported with agents, since the code execution does not reach the handler.\n\nHere's how it looks like:\n\nSTART RequestId: db1e9421-724a-11e7-a121-63fe49a029e8 Version: $LATEST\n\nUnable to import module 'lambdafunxction': No module named 'lambdafunxction'\n\nREPORT RequestId: db1e9421-724a-11e7-a121-63fe49a029e8  Duration: 15.11 ms Billed Duration: 100 ms  Memory Size: 128 MB  Max Memory Used: 18 MB\n\nMissing handler\n\nSTART RequestId: db1e9421-724a-11e7-a121-63fe49a029e8 Version: $LATEST\n\nHandler 'lambda_handlerx' missing on module\n\nREPORT RequestId: db1e9421-724a-11e7-a121-63fe49a029e8 Duration: 15.11 ms Billed Duration: 100 ms Memory Size: 128 MB Max Memory Used: 18 MB\n",
